## Clone Blango Repo

Before we continue, you need to clone the `blango` repo so you have all of your code. You will need the SSH information for your repo.

### In the Terminal

* Clone the repo. Your command should look something like this:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<your_github_username>/blango.git
```

* You should see a `blango` directory appear in the file tree.

You are now ready for the next assignment.
